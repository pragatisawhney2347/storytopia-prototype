# StoryTopia (Prototype)

StoryTopia is an AI-assisted Android application prototype built to help writers
clarify, refine, and generate story ideas. The goal of the project was to explore
end-to-end product building by combining structured idea workflows with AI-powered
text generation.

This project was created as a **learning-focused prototype**, not a production
application, and is not intended for public deployment.

## Features

- Idea clarification workflow for refining raw concepts  
- AI-assisted idea generation using external APIs  
- Local storage for saving story drafts and notes  
- Android UI designed for focused, distraction-free writing  

---

## Tech Stack

- **Android (Kotlin)**
- **API integration** for AI-powered text generation
- **Local data storage**
- **AI-assisted workflows**
- Debugging and iterative feature development

## Project Status

This repository represents a functional prototype built for experimentation
and skill development. Some features are intentionally simplified, and the
application does not handle production-level concerns such as authentication,
scalability, or public deployment.

## What I Learned

- Designing and implementing end-to-end product workflows  
- Integrating AI APIs into a mobile application  
- Debugging real-world feature interactions  
- Iterating on functionality based on usability and constraints
